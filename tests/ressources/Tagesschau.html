                    Hermine Bolte lebt im Osten Bayerns auf dem Land in einem kleinen Einfamilienhaus. Noch funktioniert
                    ihre in die Jahre gekommene Ölheizung, doch jeden Tag könnte sie kaputtgehen. Deswegen verfolgt sie
                    genau, was in der Bundesregierung derzeit diskutiert wird. Das geplante Aus von Öl- und Gasheizungen
                    macht ihr Angst. Denn Bolte weiß, dass sie sich mit ihrer Rente von 1200 Euro im Monat keine moderne
                    Wärmepumpe leisten kann: "Stehen wir alleine da? Oder bekommen wir Unterstützung von der Regierung?
                    Wie viel, wo? Gibt es einen Fördertopf?"</p>

                    Wie Bolte fragen sich derzeit Millionen Immobilienbesitzer in Deutschland, was auf sie zukommt, wenn
                    sich die Bundesregierung auf eine Änderung des Gebäudeenergiegesetzes und mehrerer Verordnungen zur
                    Umstellung der Wärmeversorgung auf erneuerbare Energien einigt. </p>


                <p class="m-ten  m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two textabsatz columns twelve">
                    Klar ist bisher: Das Bundesministerium für Wirtschafts- und Klimaschutz (BMWK) sowie das
                    Bundesbauministerium (BMWSB) wollen bereits ab Januar 2024 verbieten, neue konventionelle Öl- und
                    Gasheizungen einzubauen. So steht es im Entwurf, der sich aktuell in der Ressortabstimmung
                    befindet. </p>

                    Konkret wird gefordert, dass jede neue Heizungsanlage zu mindestens 65 Prozent mit erneuerbaren
                    Energien betrieben wird. Viele Eigentümer von Immobilien werden deswegen statt Öl- und Gasheizungen
                    in den nächsten Jahren Wärmepumpen installieren lassen. Ein Umbau, der oft jedoch mit hohen Kosten
                    verbunden ist und gerade Einkommensschwächere überfordern könnte. </p>

                    Der wohnungspolitische Sprecher der FDP-Fraktion, Daniel Föst, erinnert sich im Interview mit dem

                    erstmals sah: "Ich bin tatsächlich aufgesprungen und habe durchs Büro gerufen: 'Das kann nicht deren
                    Ernst sein'." </p>

                    Bundeswirtschaftsminister Habeck rechtfertigt seinen Plan, sieht den Gesetzesentwurf durch den

                    unterschrieben." Laut Föst sei das nicht wahr: "Das, was Habeck vorgelegt hat, ist weit über dem, wo
                    wir als FDP zugestimmt haben", erklärt er. "Das hat die FDP nie unterschrieben. Das werden wir auch

                    Konkret geht es beim Streit innerhalb der Regierungskoalition darum, dass innerhalb eines Jahres aus
                    "möglichst [...] soll", eine "Pflicht" geworden sei. Im Ergebnispapier des Koalitionsausschusses vom
                    23. März des vergangenen Jahres heißt es: "Wir werden jetzt gesetzlich festschreiben, dass ab dem 1.
                    Januar 2024 möglichst jede neu eingebaute Heizung zu 65 Prozent mit Erneuerbaren Energien betrieben
                    werden soll." Im aktuellen Gesetzentwurf dagegen wird die "[...] Einführung einer Pflicht zur
                    Nutzung von mindestens 65 Prozent erneuerbare Energien bei jedem Einbau einer neuen Heizung in neuen
                    oder in bestehenden Gebäuden [...]" genannt. </p>

                    Der Einbau einer Wärmepumpe und die damit häufig einhergehenden Sanierungsarbeiten belaufen sich in
                    der Regel auf mehrere 10.000 Euro. Bundeswirtschaftsminister Robert Habeck verspricht daher in der
                    vergangenen Woche auf der internationalen Handwerksmesse in München: "Es ist völlig klar, dass die
                    höheren Kosten bei Wärmepumpen für diejenigen, die sich die sonst nicht leisten könnten, aufgefangen
                    oder gemildert werden müssen." </p>

                    Was das konkret bedeutet, sagt er nicht. Auf Nachfrage, mit welcher Unterstützung etwa Rentner
                    rechnen könnten, die 50.000 Euro in eine neue Heizungsanlage investieren müssen, weicht der Minister
                    aus: Es gebe noch keine abgestimmte Vorlage, "und wenn die Vorlage abgestimmt ist im Gesetz, dann
                    stelle ich auch die konkreten Finanzierungen vor".</p>

                    Im Gesetzesentwurf heißt es zur Förderung Einkommensschwächerer lediglich: "Die Bundesregierung
                    plant, diese Förderung künftig stärker auch auf kapital- und einkommensschwache Eigentümer
                    auszurichten, um zu gewährleisten, dass die Verpflichteten finanziell die notwendigen Investitionen
                    tätigen können." Woher die Fördermittel jedoch kommen sollen, ist unklar.</p>

                    So geht es auch Rentnerin Bolte aus der Oberpfalz im Osten Bayerns. Sie hofft auf Hilfe von der
                    Politik. Da sie nicht weiß, wie sie eine neue Heizungsanlage finanzieren sollte, sucht sie Hilfe bei
                    ihrem Bürgermeister. Marcus Gradl von der CSU kennt sich aus mit Förderprogramen und deren
                    Problemen: "Ich würde den ganzen Förder-Dschungel als Irrsinn bezeichnen. Wie soll sich der normale
                    Bürger hier zurechtfinden?" Konkret hat er nur einen Tipp für Bolte: Sie solle sich rechtzeitig
                    einen professionellen Energieberater suchen, der sich um die Förderung - sobald sie denn geklärt ist
                    - kümmert. Das Problem: Auch den Energieberater muss sie selbst bezahlen.&nbsp;</p>
