            "They are concerned about the pipeline’s potential impact on indigenous communities, cherished national parks, animals and plants that inhabit the Namibian coast, which has been declared the eighth largest marine protected area in the world and the largest in Africa.",
            "Despite these concerns, the two governments have given technocrats from both countries six months to amend agreements to include green hydrogen.",
            "The pipeline will stretch from the Kunene region via Walvis Bay in the Erongo region, along the coast to Lüderitz and Boegoebaai, located 20km south of the border between Namibia and South Africa, in the Northern Cape.",
            "Namibia has about six green hydrogen projects intended to be connected to South Africa through a corridor.",
            "“You have different locations you need to connect with the infrastructure. It’s more efficient when you develop this corridor by sharing infrastructure,” minister of mines and energy Tom Alweendo told The Namibian last month at the green hydrogen summit in Cape Town.",
            "“You can then connect that to South Africa. It could work independently, but why not make it bigger by having a corridor?” he suggested.",
            "The scope of cooperation between the two countries since 2013 is anchored by 74 agreements, however, none makes provision for green hydrogen.",
            "“While we are looking at amplifying our [agreement], there is nothing stopping us from carrying out the work,” he said.Alweendo said the necessary infrastructure is already being constructed.",
            "STRATEGIC CORRIDORS",
            "In 2021, the South African government laid out strategic gas pipeline corridors in nine phases.",
            "Phase six includes a pipeline that connects Abraham Villiers Bay in the Northern Cape to Oranjemund in Namibia.",
            "South Africa’s minister of electricity, Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, told The Namibian last month that the two countries would sign a new agreement to include green hydrogen opportunities.",
            "“The principals [two presidents] gave us an instruction to expand the [agreement] to include those opportunities and come back in six months,” he said.",
            "“We see it as an opportunity for us to benefit from scale and aggregation. The potential for shared infrastructure is a functional conversation we are having with Namibia,” Ramokgopa said.",
            "The mooted green hydrogen pipeline project will be managed by the government-owned Transnet on the South African side.",
            "‘MASSIVE RISKS’",
            "However, Transnet pipelines executive Russell Bradbrooke has reservations about the project.",
            "“It’s an option to transport green hydrogen in its initial form instead of ammonia. If we are going to do a long-distance hydrogen pipeline, I have a lot of concerns,” he said, referring to theft along Transnet’s pipelines.",
            "Bradbrooke said warning people of the risk of green hydrogen would not deter them.",
            "“We have a lot of challenges with people trying to steal fuel.",
            "“It is a potential thing, but I think it will bring massive risks. If you try to steal from that green hydrogen pipeline and you get it wrong, then you have really destroyed massive infrastructure, and possibly [caused] deaths in the area.”",
            "Green hydrogen can be transported in its initial form or in the form of ammonia.",
            "The head of Transnet’s engineering centre of excellence, Tauqeer Ahmed, says the problem with liquefying hydrogen is that it involves extreme effort.",
            "“Commercially, it doesn’t make sense. It is just too expensive. If you are transporting green hydrogen within the city, it makes sense to liquify it.",
            "“In a perfect world without theft and other risks, transporting green hydrogen in a pipe from city to city or country to country, you won’t have to worry about ammonia and methanol to break it up and crack open again.",
            "“However, for us to export our green hydrogen internationally, to be cost effective, our best bet would be ammonia and methanol, because of the long distance.”",
            "Mlungisi Mvoko, the finance, economic development, environmental affairs and tourism member of the Eastern Cape’s executive council, wants to see the corridor stretching as far as Angola.",
            "“Bringing in Angola and Namibia is important for the Southern African Development Community region and Africa, which means we will be facing the world together.",
            "“The cooperation we would have with Namibia and Angola would actually create complementary competition in Africa.”",
            "POTENTIAL DAMAGE",
            "While the Namibian and South African governments say they have met with rural communities and assessed potential damage, environmentalists say nothing has been done to ensure the environment is not damaged.",
            "Environmental justice activist Rinaani Musutua says the construction of a pipeline in a protected area would heavily impact or completely destroy the ecological functioning of the whole area or park.",
            "“… including the unique and important coastal and marine habitats ..,” she says.",
            "Musutua says such a large industrial project contradicts the tourism development plan adopted by the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism in 2020.",
            "“This underlines that Namibia is no longer committed to conservation and sustainable development,” she says.",
            "Musutua said the project should not have been envisaged before a comprehensive strategic environmental and social assessment, adding that the environmental clause in the Namibian Constitution should be respected.",
            "Other environmentalists say a well-detailed environmental protection plan has not been drafted.",
            "“In the absence of such a plan, marine and wildlife, migratory birds and the world’s only arid biodiversity hotspots would also be permanently and irreversibly damaged,” Environmental organisation Frack Free Namibia says.",
            "Frack Free Namibia says green hydrogen seriously jeopardises the Tsau //Khaeb National Park if an integrated park management plan is not adopted.",
            "Lauren Nel from Natural Justice in Cape Town says: “We demand full disclosure of the business deals entered into at the summit, including the [agreements] signed at the commencement.”",
            "Samson Mokoena from South African-based Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance says: “In this hydrogen rush, we are seeing no clear policy direction.”"

            "Mbumba opened up for the first time about Geingob’s final days in a candid interview with the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) on Sunday.",
            "Alongside him during the NBC interview was National Assembly speaker Peter Katjavivi.",

            "When the plane flew to the US on 24 January, Mbumba had high hopes that the president would return to his old energetic self.",
            "NEVER SAY GOODBYE",
            "Mbumba said he and Geingob never said the word “goodbye” to each other whenever Geingob was flying out of the country.",
            "The day Geingob left for his medical treatment trip to the US was no different.",
            "He accompanied the president and his team to the airport to send him off.",
            "“I was there when he left [for the US]; we shook hands. We did not say much. The two of us had this habit never to say goodbye to one another,” Mbumba recalled.",
            "Geingob had travelled to the US for novel cancer treatment.",
            "Mbumba said since the day Geingob left the country for the US, he was constantly in touch with the team that joined the late president, which was unusual.",
            "He added that when Geingob returned home, there were some difficulties connecting in Algiers.",
            "He got a message from one of the president’s security staff when they were flying over Nigeria.",
            "UNUSUAL ENVELOPE",
            "He said the day before Geingob departed to the US, he gave him an envelope with the communication that he would be acting president while the president was away.",
            "He said usually he received this envelope at the airport, but this time it was different.",
            "“Uniquely, this time when he left for the US, it was the first time it was announced the vice president would be the one acting. Usually I just get the envelope at the airport, and also this time was the very first time I got the envelope the day before the departure.",
            "“I have never had that type of experience. Certain things were happening, which we could not read, which we cannot understand, but maybe those were the omens of things to come,” Mbumba said.",
            "He said the personnel also communicated that they were entering Angolan airspace and that when they arrived in the country, they would go straight to Lady Pohamba Private Hospital in Windhoek.",
            "STRANGE PHONE CALL",
            "“The morning they woke up here [after returning from the US] I got a call from his phone. My reaction was, is the president already working? But that call was from madam Geingos to indicate that I need to come and be updated by the doctors,” Mbumba said.",
            "He said the update he got from the president’s medical team gave him hope that Geingob would recover.",
            "“But the situation never really improved, it remained stable but [did] not improve until it just hit us hard,” Mbumba said.",
            "Mbumba said he was present when doctors told those at the hospital: “We just lost him.”",
            "BREAKING THE NEWS TO THE WORLD",
            "Mbumba said he considered how to break the news to the nation and the world.",
            "“It was very difficult to be the one announcing the death of your brother, your friend, your colleague, your boss, the man who appointed you to the position you are having. It was very difficult to make a public announcement,” he recalled.",
            "“As we were working on the statement, people were calling me, and I answered and told them yes, this is what happened, they are the ones to announce it, and it cannot be announced by anybody – it had to be announced by somebody with authority to do so on behalf of everybody else.",
            "“We must respect the structure of the government,” he said.",
            "“Hage Geingob passed on young in mind and heart. He died on duty,” Mbumba said.",
            "‘WE HAD PLANS AFTER RETIREMENT’",
            "Katjavivi, one of Geingob’s close friends and peers, was one of the people who visited Geingob hours before he took his final breath.",
            "He said he and a few other people were called to the hospital on 3 February after five o’clock. He said they were briefed by Geingob’s medical team.",
            "“It gave us a sense of hope that [other] options are available to the medical team to do their best, but I recall when we were taken in to view him in the ICU I looked carefully at his face and I wanted to leave with something symbolising hope.",
            "“I may be wrong, but it was a very difficult period, and I felt I was looking at his eyes, eyebrows, and I thought his eyebrows were moving and I left the ICU. I was talking to myself, comforting myself that there is a hope for recovery,” he said.",
            "Katjavivi said in the early hours of Sunday morning while still asleep, he received a call that the president had died.",
            "He said he, Mbumba and Geingob planned to settle at Swakopmund and to sometimes walk barefoot by the seaside and have coffee at a nearby café.",
            "GOING HOME TO DIE",
            "Political analyst Henning Melber questions the circumstances surrounding Geingob’s departure, suggesting that if an inner circle was aware of his imminent passing, his trip to the US wouldn’t have been for medical treatment.",
            "Melber speculates that Geingob may have realised his life was ending during his time in the US and chose to return home to die.",
            "However, Melber questions why this should be a contentious issue.",
            "“This means that as of his arrival back in Namibia people may have become aware that not much time was left. But why make an issue of it?",
            "“If one could provide evidence that it was exploited for dubious arrangements, it would be another matter. But I do not see any indications pointing reliably into such a direction,” he says."
