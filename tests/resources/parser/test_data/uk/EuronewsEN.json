            "In a report published over the weekend, the paper claimed that the leaks included information about enemies of gang members involved in the relationships. The report alleged that in four cases, the leaks were followed by revenge attacks, including murders.",

            "\"We will discuss the information that has now emerged, what measures the police are already taking to counteract this type of infiltrators, whether there are further measures to be taken, and whether we have reason to request further measures from the government and politicians,\" he added.",
