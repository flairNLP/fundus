            "We Brits love a good theme park holiday and for many a trip to Walt Disney World in Florida would be a dream come true – but it can cost a hefty sum.",
            "Luckily, there are a number of hacks that can save you a fortune from the best day to book flights to how to get free food for your entire holiday.",
            "Booking insider Tessa Bishop, Head of Sales and Customer Services at Ocean Florida , shared the best times you should look at booking your dream Disney holiday to make sure you get the cheapest deal for what your family needs. That way you can get your dream holiday at the right budget.",
            "According to Tessa the best time to book a Disney holiday is usually through April and May (for the following year) as this is when they usually run their early booking offers. That means that if you're thinking about a Disney trip, now couldn’t be a better time to book. Many of the deals are currently live and due to limited availability sell out fast so you may need to be quick.",
            "One such offer is Free Disney Dining and Drinks, which launched on the April 18 – it is the perfect opportunity to grab a deal that can save you thousands on your holiday as you don't have to shell out a fortune for food in the parks. Tessa explained: \"For the first time since 2019, they have brought back the Disney Dine offer which can save up to £2,000 per booking. With this package, you can enjoy free dining and drinks during your 2025 trip when staying in Disney Hotels.\"",
            "The offers are just one way to save, however, as even something as simple as the day of the week you book can make a difference to the cost of your holiday. Tessa noted: \"Always try to make a booking on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Sunday as this is likely where you can get a better price on flights.\"",
            "According to the expert, the best month to book is January as this is when most flight sales are on by all major airlines, which Tessa says: \"can save you up to £1,200 per booking.\"",
            "Tessa isn't the only travel insider with useful tips on saving money though. Marketing Manager at Ocean Florida Abby Dunn, who has travelled to Florida over 42 times, shared her top six savvy booking tips to cut the cost of your holiday.",
            "Abby said: \"I’d always recommend purchasing your park tickets at the time of booking your package holiday. The main theme parks increase their prices often, so securing them as early as you can means you have that lower price locked in and can avoid any fluctuations - which could result in you spending more.\"",
            "The Florida fan explained: \"Try and be flexible with your departure date, and if you can, don’t restrict yourself to the usual seven, ten, or fourteen-night holidays. Often odd durations like nine or fifteen nights can be cheaper, even once you have considered extra hotel costs and spending money.\"",
            "She noted: \"For Orlando Holidays you’re likely to look at flights straight to Orlando, but I would suggest looking at alternative airports nearby such as Tampa as doing this can save you at least £400 per booking depending on the time of year you travel and still provide well-connected transfer facilities .\"",
            "\"We already know to try and avoid UK school holidays, but also consider the same for students in the USA, as this also has an impact on accommodation prices and crowd levels in the parks,\" commented Abby. \"For example, UK children have two weeks off at Easter. In the US, however, this is classed as ‘Spring Break’ and thanks to the different states having different school out dates, this busy holiday period often lasts a month!\"",
            "The expert said: \"Disney World is a great event space and because of this, they tend to host a wide variety of sporting events. Check the calendars to try to avoid any events of this type, such as a RunDisney Event and the Cheerleading & Dance World Championships, as this will increase costs significantly.",
            "\"Of course, if you’re looking to tie in your trip with the Fifa World Cup, it’s important to start thinking about booking your 2026 Orlando Holiday now to avoid staggering prices!\"",
            "Abby commented: \"I would always consider a multi-centre stay to save money. By staying at Disney for four nights for example and then twinning this with a villa stay, you often save money on accommodation but still get the benefits of onsite stays. There are so many amazing villas available at different price points that cater to different needs, making them the perfect place to stay during the duration of your Florida holiday.\"",
