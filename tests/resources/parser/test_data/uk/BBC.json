            "The value of the pound crashed, signalling that international investors had no confidence in the government's measures, and the Bank of England was forced to step in to protect pension funds.",
            "The OBR had offered to prepare a draft economic forecast, but the government rejected the offer.",
            "Many said the decision not to consult the OBR was a key reason for the lack of investor confidence.",

            "After Rachel Reeves' first major speech as chancellor, the OBR also suggested there were billions of pounds of spending pressures that it did not know about when preparing its last forecast in March.",
            "While the Conservatives have said they have always provided the necessary information, Rachel Reeves has pledged to further strengthen the OBR to avoid any future \"cliff edge\" being identified.",
            "In a letter, she said the OBR would be able to question government assumptions about spending by departments, as well as demand more details on whether departments were likely to overspend or underspend.",
            "She also said that spending reviews would now happen every two years, with detailed plans being set out in advance."
