            "Finding the best heated clothes airer may not sound like the most exciting of pursuits. But as a means of drying your clothes in winter, these gadgets are hard to beat. Not only is a heated airer far kinder to your treasured garments than tumble drying (it adds years to the lifespan of your clothes), it’s also better for the environment, and arguably cheaper to run: around 10p per hour, as opposed to around £2 per load in a tumble dryer based on current electricity prices. They also help to eliminate that damp washing smell and can be folded away for compact storage.",
            "Since the price of energy soared, we’re seeing a lot of interest in simple money-saving devices like air fryers, electric blankets and electric heaters. Heated clothes airers have been the surprise hit. But which is the best? I’ve tried them all and my full reviews are below, followed by a guide to how to use them. If you’re pressed for time, here’s a look at my top five:"

Instead of wrapping delicates in towels and balancing them precariously on the bathroom radiator, or hanging dresses up in the shower to drip-dry, an electric airer means I can just wring them out gently and lay them flat to dry.(In fact, I now only ever use a tumble dryer for towels or bedding.)",
            "Heated airers are also a good way of minimising crinkles, so you might not need to invest in an iron or a steamer."

            "Currently £204.98, Lakeland",
            "Best heated clothes airer overall, 9/10",
            "We like: the addition of a ventilated cover speeds up the drying process",
            "We don’t like: it’s large when deployed",
            "This is the ultimate heated airer for a large family or someone with a sizeable wardrobe. It holds up to 15kg of wet washing on 21m of drying space and dries the fastest of all those I’ve tested, thanks to a clever heat-retaining cover which can be bought separately or as a bundle with the dryer for a £15 saving.",
            "Running at 300w, it costs 15p an hour to use at current prices. It’s tall enough for hanging long items like trousers and towels, and the adaptable rungs mean you can lay up to six jumpers flat for speedy drying. My colleague Debora Robertson swears by it as the best way of drying bras and Sally Hughes of laundry experts Kair recommends it to make delicates last longer.",
            "I found the Dry:Soon took around four to five hours to dry lighter materials; and closer to 10-12 for heavier jumpers and the like. In the world of heated clothes airers, that’s really pretty good – the cover certainly does its job.",
            "I also appreciated the overall design. Yes, I know we’re talking about a clothes rack here – but the Dry:Soon felt like it had been well thought through. It’s pretty light (7.7kg) and the carry handle is helpful if you need to move the unit into another room. And, despite being fairly large once deployed, it folds flat and compact, down to 8cm deep, so it’s a neat thing to store.",
            "If this one is still too big for the space you have (when fully open, it measures 70x74x132.5cm), Lakeland also have a mini version. The Dry:Soon Mini standard 3-tier heater measures 60x63x113.5cm fully open, and has 13m drying space, running at 198w (£129.99, Lakeland).",
            "Personally, I favour the larger version – if you’re using it anyway, you might as well dry two loads at once and then put it away until next time. Both come with Lakeland’s standard three-year guarantee."

            "We like: massively reduces ironing time on shirts and blouses",
            "We don’t like: it costs more per hour to run than most heated airers",
            "Rather than heated rungs, this variation on the heated airer features a 70C fan. It circulates hot air around your clothes, which are encased in a tent-like, ventilated outer cover. This means it dries clothes faster than other airers.",
            "It’s effectively a fan on detachable tripod feet with a pole, at the top of which there are six spokes designed to hold up to 12 hangers of spin-dried or well-wrung damp clothing (up to 10kg). It’s particularly useful for shirts and blouses, since being able to hang T-shirts in this way means they dry straight with minimal creases, meaning less ironing. But it’s less useful for drying, say, towels.",
            "I found it easy enough to slot the contraption together the first time I took it out of the surprisingly small box it arrived in, with no tools required. It packs right down back into it, which is handy for those short of utility space. When in use, it’s a compact means to dry almost two weeks’ worth of shirts (measuring 62cm x 146cm). It’s lighter than many other airers, too, weighing just 3.54kg.",
            "I was concerned the fan would be noisy, but unlike a tumble dryer, it’s very quiet at less than 52dB. It states that it takes around one to three hours to dry your laundry. Delicates were perfectly dry after even less, but shirts took around an hour and denim a little longer. A timer can be set to either a minimum of 30 minutes or a maximum of 180 minutes.",
            "As with all heated airers, it consumes less energy than a conventional tumble dryer. Of course, it still uses more electricity than hanging shirts to dry naturally. Running at 1,000 Watts, it also uses more energy than some other airers featured here, but it makes up for it in efficiency (and it’s very useful in the event that you’ve run out of emergency shirts)."

            "We don’t like: it’s wider than it looks",
            "Heated airers can look pretty same-y but this John Lewis option stands out from the crowd thanks to one small thing: shoe dryers. If you’ve been caught out in a storm and had to stuff your shoes full of old newspapers of kitchen towels to dry them, only to find them still slightly soggy the next day, this is for you.",
            "Plus, the dryer can hold 15kg of washing with 5kg recommended for each layer. The bars heat up to a temperature on the cusp of being too hot to touch, add a cover (you’ll have to buy one separately) and they are. I’ve found the trick with drying delicates is lying them across the bars rather than hanging them over and risking stretching. Using hangers through the middle of the bars is also highly effective for drying shirts and stops the usual criticism that heated airers only dry the bit touching the bars.",
            "The dryer does stand quite wide when set up, at 66cm, which is a little wide for my small apartment although it folds completely flat which is handy for storage. I don’t actually mind that it takes up so much room, because I find it even heats the surrounding air, doubling as a low power radiator."

It boasts three tiers on which to either drape clothes flat to dry, or on which to hang them. The tiers can be rearranged (by unfolding one half of the rung down), making way to dry longer items such as trousers, dresses, towels or bedding.",
            "Because it’s vertical, I think it’s an efficient shape in terms of how much space it takes up (handy if you only have a small space) and more pleasing to the eye than more horizontal designs. It also folds flat, for nifty storage. In lightweight aluminium, it’s light (5.5kg, to be precise) and easy to lug about.",
            "It holds a decent weight of clothes and feels incredibly sturdy. As with all of these airers, it arrives assembled - so all you need to do is simply fold it out, plug it in and switch it on. Ta da!"

            "I’ve set this up in my bathroom and use it for towels and to dry any excess laundry which can’t fit on my main dryer - usually underwear. It doesn’t get as warm as options higher up but it’s great for drying damp towels in spring and autumn when it’s not cold enough to turn on the radiator.",
            "It’s a useful size and portable enough to move from room to room. I’ve also found it helps keep mould at bay. All in all a well-priced, versatile dryer emitting gentle heat."

            "Completely different from all the others, this is no good at all for domestic laundry drying but we can’t resist a quirky gadget. If you prefer to do a quick garment wash in a hotel sink rather than send it down for cleaning, the hot air vents in this chunky clothes hanger’s extendable arms will quick-dry shirts, socks or undies in the time it takes to drink a minibar beer.",
            "The drawbacks are that it uses a 230V British plug and would be much less effective on a 110V American power supply, and it is a little noisy (think hair dryer on low setting). The advantages are that, since it doesn’t use a lithium battery, you can pack it in your carry-on luggage.",
            "The killer app is that the arms can be rotated around to fit inside shoes as well as clothes. This makes the Aerative a super-fast fix if you get caught in a downpour and need to be bone dry in time for an appointment. For that reason, we’ll be keeping one in the desk at Telegraph towers."
