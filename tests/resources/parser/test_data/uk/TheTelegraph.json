            "Finding the best heated clothes airer may not sound like the most exciting of pursuits. But as a means of drying your clothes in winter, these gadgets are hard to beat. Not only is a heated airer far kinder to your treasured garments than tumble drying (it adds years to the lifespan of your clothes), it’s also better for the environment, and arguably cheaper to run: around 10p per hour, as opposed to around £2 per load in a tumble dryer based on current electricity prices. They also help to eliminate that damp washing smell and can be folded away for compact storage.",
            "Since the price of energy soared, we’re seeing a lot of interest in simple money-saving devices like air fryers, electric blankets and electric heaters. Heated clothes airers have been the surprise hit. But which is the best? I’ve tried them all and my full reviews are below, followed by a guide to how to use them. If you’re pressed for time, here’s a look at my top five:"

            "Currently £204.98, Lakeland",
            "Best heated clothes airer overall, 9/10",
            "We like: the addition of a ventilated cover speeds up the drying process",
            "We don’t like: it’s large when deployed",
            "This is the ultimate heated airer for a large family or someone with a sizeable wardrobe. It holds up to 15kg of wet washing on 21m of drying space and dries the fastest of all those I’ve tested, thanks to a clever heat-retaining cover which can be bought separately or as a bundle with the dryer for a £15 saving.",
            "Running at 300w, it costs 15p an hour to use at current prices. It’s tall enough for hanging long items like trousers and towels, and the adaptable rungs mean you can lay up to six jumpers flat for speedy drying. My colleague Debora Robertson swears by it as the best way of drying bras and Sally Hughes of laundry experts Kair recommends it to make delicates last longer.",
            "I found the Dry:Soon took around four to five hours to dry lighter materials; and closer to 10-12 for heavier jumpers and the like. In the world of heated clothes airers, that’s really pretty good – the cover certainly does its job.",
            "I also appreciated the overall design. Yes, I know we’re talking about a clothes rack here – but the Dry:Soon felt like it had been well thought through. It’s pretty light (7.7kg) and the carry handle is helpful if you need to move the unit into another room. And, despite being fairly large once deployed, it folds flat and compact, down to 8cm deep, so it’s a neat thing to store.",
            "If this one is still too big for the space you have (when fully open, it measures 70x74x132.5cm), Lakeland also have a mini version. The Dry:Soon Mini standard 3-tier heater measures 60x63x113.5cm fully open, and has 13m drying space, running at 198w (£129.99, Lakeland).",
            "Personally, I favour the larger version – if you’re using it anyway, you might as well dry two loads at once and then put it away until next time. Both come with Lakeland’s standard three-year guarantee."

            "We like: massively reduces ironing time on shirts and blouses",
            "We don’t like: it costs more per hour to run than most heated airers",
            "Rather than heated rungs, this variation on the heated airer features a 70C fan. It circulates hot air around your clothes, which are encased in a tent-like, ventilated outer cover. This means it dries clothes faster than other airers.",
            "It’s effectively a fan on detachable tripod feet with a pole, at the top of which there are six spokes designed to hold up to 12 hangers of spin-dried or well-wrung damp clothing (up to 10kg). It’s particularly useful for shirts and blouses, since being able to hang T-shirts in this way means they dry straight with minimal creases, meaning less ironing. But it’s less useful for drying, say, towels.",
            "I found it easy enough to slot the contraption together the first time I took it out of the surprisingly small box it arrived in, with no tools required. It packs right down back into it, which is handy for those short of utility space. When in use, it’s a compact means to dry almost two weeks’ worth of shirts (measuring 62cm x 146cm). It’s lighter than many other airers, too, weighing just 3.54kg.",
            "I was concerned the fan would be noisy, but unlike a tumble dryer, it’s very quiet at less than 52dB. It states that it takes around one to three hours to dry your laundry. Delicates were perfectly dry after even less, but shirts took around an hour and denim a little longer. A timer can be set to either a minimum of 30 minutes or a maximum of 180 minutes.",
            "As with all heated airers, it consumes less energy than a conventional tumble dryer. Of course, it still uses more electricity than hanging shirts to dry naturally. Running at 1,000 Watts, it also uses more energy than some other airers featured here, but it makes up for it in efficiency (and it’s very useful in the event that you’ve run out of emergency shirts)."

If you’ve been caught out in a storm and had to stuff your shoes full of old newspapers of kitchen towels to dry them, only to find them still slightly soggy the next day, this is for you.",
            "Plus, the dryer can hold 15kg of washing with 5kg recommended for each layer. The bars heat up to a temperature on the cusp of being too hot to touch, add a cover (you’ll have to buy one separately) and they are. I’ve found the trick with drying delicates is lying them across the bars rather than hanging them over and risking stretching. Using hangers through the middle of the bars is also highly effective for drying shirts and stops the usual criticism that heated airers only dry the bit touching the bars.",
            "The dryer does stand quite wide when set up, at 66cm, which is a little wide for my small apartment although it folds completely flat which is handy for storage. I don’t actually mind that it takes up so much room, because I find it even heats the surrounding air, doubling as a low power radiator."

It boasts three tiers on which to either drape clothes flat to dry, or on which to hang them. The tiers can be rearranged (by unfolding one half of the rung down), making way to dry longer items such as trousers, dresses, towels or bedding.",
            "Because it’s vertical, I think it’s an efficient shape in terms of how much space it takes up (handy if you only have a small space) and more pleasing to the eye than more horizontal designs. It also folds flat, for nifty storage. In lightweight aluminium, it’s light (5.5kg, to be precise) and easy to lug about.",
            "It holds a decent weight of clothes and feels incredibly sturdy. As with all of these airers, it arrives assembled - so all you need to do is simply fold it out, plug it in and switch it on. Ta da!"

            "I’ve set this up in my bathroom and use it for towels and to dry any excess laundry which can’t fit on my main dryer - usually underwear. It doesn’t get as warm as options higher up but it’s great for drying damp towels in spring and autumn when it’s not cold enough to turn on the radiator.",

If you prefer to do a quick garment wash in a hotel sink rather than send it down for cleaning, the hot air vents in this chunky clothes hanger’s extendable arms will quick-dry shirts, socks or undies in the time it takes to drink a minibar beer.",
            "The drawbacks are that it uses a 230V British plug and would be much less effective on a 110V American power supply, and it is a little noisy (think hair dryer on low setting). The advantages are that, since it doesn’t use a lithium battery, you can pack it in your carry-on luggage.",
            "The killer app is that the arms can be rotated around to fit inside shoes as well as clothes. This makes the Aerative a super-fast fix if you get caught in a downpour and need to be bone dry in time for an appointment. For that reason, we’ll be keeping one in the desk at Telegraph towers."

            "Sir Keir Starmer has defended accepting gifts from a millionaire Labour donor who was later given a pass to access No 10 Downing Street.",
            "The Prime Minister suggested he would continue to take gifts from Lord Alli, despite a row over some of his donations not being declared in line with parliamentary rules.",
            "The Labour peer has given Sir Keir tens of thousands of pounds to spend on suits and spectacles, and over the weekend it emerged that Lady Starmer, the Prime Minister’s wife, had also been given £5,000 worth of clothes and personal shopping.",
            "Asked on Monday whether he would continue to accept gifts from Lord Alli, Sir Keir said that “all Members of Parliament get gifts” and “the important thing is that they’re declared in accordance with the rules”.",
            "It can also be revealed that the Labour peer lent the Starmers his house at times during the election, as part of accommodation worth more than £20,000.",
            "On Monday, Lady Starmer attended Edeline Lee’s London Fashion Week show in an outfit lent to her by the designer.",
            "It came a day after it emerged that Sir Keir had initially failed to declare the £5,000 of donations covering the cost of his wife’s personal shopper, clothes and alterations.",
            "MPs are supposed to declare gifts and donations to the parliamentary authorities within 28 days of receiving them. They have to declare “any interest which someone might reasonably consider to influence their actions or words as an MP”, and the declarations are then published on the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.",
            "However, the Prime Minister declared the gifts to his wife, thought to have been received both before and after he entered Downing Street, only last week after initially believing that they did not need to be added to the register.",
            "On Monday night No 10 confirmed the Standards Commissioner declined to carry out an investigation into Sir Keir’s failure to declare donations from Lord Alli, following calls from the Tories.",
            "A Tory source said: “It’s shocking that Lady Starmer thought it acceptable to strut her way through London Fashion Week adorned in free designer swag the day after it was revealed Keir Starmer had failed to declare donations for clothing gifted to his wife.”",
            "Lady Starmer is one of several wives of prime ministers to have worn clothes by British designers to showcase the country’s fashion industry. She has repeatedly worn dresses by the British brand Me+Em.",
            "Lord Alli provided the Labour leader with accommodation worth more than £20,000 from 29 May, the week after the election was called, to 13 July, a week after Labour’s landslide victory.",
            "He was at Lord Alli’s house on the night of the election – July 4 – to see the exit poll and watch early results come in, before going to his constituency count at Camden town hall, north London.",
            "The revelation shows the strength of the relationship between Lord Alli and the Prime Minister. He is Sir Keir’s biggest personal donor and has given nearly £1 million to the Labour Party and its politicians over the past 20 years.",
            "On Monday, Sir Keir dodged several questions on whether he would continue taking handouts from Lord Alli, pledging only to “comply with the rules”.",
            "He said it would be “pushing it a bit far” to deny him the right to accept Arsenal tickets, as he could not sit in his usual seat for security reasons.",
            "Sir Keir accepted more than 20 free tickets to football matches in the last Parliament, according to figures released in July, using complimentary seats to watch Arsenal play Manchester United, Manchester City and Porto.",
            "He was pictured with David Lammy, the Foreign Secretary, at Sunday’s north London derby against Tottenham. Mr Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, posted a photo of the pair at the match on X, formerly Twitter.",
            "Sir Keir said on Monday: “All Members of Parliament get gifts. The rules then say that over a certain value you’ve got to declare the gifts, so everybody can see what it was, how much it was, who it came from, and so that you and others can ask questions about it. That’s a good framework. It’s the right framework.”",
            "Asked whether he thought he had done nothing wrong, and whether he would continue taking those sorts of donations, he said: “The problem is, let’s take football as an example. I’m a massive Arsenal fan. I can’t go into the stands because of security reasons. Therefore if I don’t accept a gift of hospitality I can’t go to a game.",
            "“You could say, well, bad luck. That’s why gifts have to be registered. But you know, never going to an Arsenal game again because I can’t accept hospitality is pushing it a bit far.”",
            "Asked again whether he would continue to accept gifts from Lord Alli, he said: “Well, wherever there are gifts from anyone I’m going to comply with the rules… Look, there are gifts to all MPs of different sizes and shapes. The important thing is that they’re declared in accordance with the rules.”",
            "Asked whether an anti-corruption advisor would be appointed, he went on: “Well, there’s a massive difference between declarations and corruption. Declarations are about declaring properly so that you and others can see properly made declarations.”",
            "On Sunday, Mr Lammy said the Prime Minister and his wife had accepted the donations so they could “look their best” to represent the UK, adding that the US had a “huge budget from the taxpayer” to clothe its leaders.",
            "Asked on Monday why he did not buy his own clothes and what he made of Mr Lammy’s comments, Sir Keir said: “I certainly don’t think we should have a budget for it at the taxpayers’ expense, in relation to gifts of any sort.”",
            "The Conservatives’ letter to Daniel Greenberg, the standards commissioner, said: “In August it was reported that Lord Alli had been given a temporary Downing Street security pass despite having no formal government role. It was reported that he had played an active role in selecting Cabinet (and other) appointments.",
            "“It has now emerged that at the same time Sir Keir Starmer failed to declare a substantial gift of designer clothes, tailoring and a personal shopper bought for his wife by Lord Alli, both prior to the general election on July 4 2024 and following it.”",
            "The letter also said that “there must be a full investigation into this scandal, given that this is not the first instance of the Prime Minister failing to declare donations and abiding by parliamentary rules.”",
            "On Monday night, Number 10 said the parliamentary commissioner for standards had said there would be no investigation into late declarations."
