            "Because of this recent experience of war only a couple of generations ago, Finland has always maintained a relatively high level of preparedness, including armed forces based on mandatory conscription for men.",
            "In the early 2010s, Sweden swapped a mandatory military service for men for a professional model more akin to the UK system.",
            "But just seven years later, it made a U-turn and brought back military draft, but this time for both men and women.",
