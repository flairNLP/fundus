            "Romance novelists gathered with readers at a Rom Con to discuss writing and publishing in the Mother City, at the weekend.",
            "These discussions took place at Exclusive Books, Waterfront, on Saturday, June 21.",
            "Three panels of authors, from Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, spoke with heart about their love of reading, writing and happily ever afters.",
            "Author Rushdiyah Narker, from Kensington, said she started reading regency romance because it was the closest to what romance was like for Muslims.",
            "\"There's always this bruh, but I can't let him know that I like him. Everybody must see me stare at him because my mom is going to scold,\" she said.",
            "Ms Narker’s book entitled Some Unspoken Thing is available on pre-order from Loot and will be in stores on August 1.",
            "\"I read everything. I read thrillers, mysteries and romance. I always come back to romance because you know you're going to get a happy ending,\" she said.",
            "She explained that it was a form of \"escapism\".",
            "\"With the world being so shit, why can't we just have our happy endings? I don't make excuses for reading romance. It's what I enjoy; if you don't like that, then bye,\" she said.",
            "Novelist Jo Watson, from Johannesburg, who has written dozens of romance books, admitted that it was \"not my vibe\" and had not read the genre before putting pen to paper, which is ironic since she is widely considered to be South Africa's most successful romance writer and other romance authors jokingly call her \"their queen\".",
            "Author Nuhaa Bardien, from Brooklyn, said she started reading romance novels before she was allowed to, as a teenager, because she got an adult library card.",
            "\"I am a big romance reader. I love any kind of romance and if it doesn't have romance then I'm probably not reading it,\" she said.",
            "She said she enjoyed historical romance, which is her favourite.",
            "Durban author Arini Vlotman, who also got an adult library card, said: \"I love romance. Give me all of the romance, in whatever genre, in whatever form, in whichever year. I started as the stereotypical youngster going to the library and I went through each shelf because there were only so many books.\"",
            "Moderator and author Shameez Patel Papathanasiou, from Goodwood, asked why romance was popular but ridiculed. The authors concurred that it was a \"taboo\" genre but that women were owning their \"pleasures\".",
            "Ms Bardien said that it makes one \"so happy\" and it was somewhere readers could find comfort.",
            "\"People are like, 'oh my gosh, it's horrible or it's porn' or they degrade it. There's so much more to it. If you look at just all our stories, they're so different, but there's something there for everyone, or there is a story out there for everyone,\" she said.",
            "Author Qarnita Loxton, from Melkbosstrand, spoke about sneaking Mills and Boons books from her 50-year-old aunt's room.",
            "\"She was a lot older than me, in my teens, and we read the same books because it gave warmth, love and hopeful feelings that transcend generations,\" she said.",
            "Ms Loxton said South Africa had a unique market of readers, as more non-fiction books are sold compared to its counterparts.",
            "\"I think it is growing, the market is growing. Women are buying books. Women in the age group that we are writing in have disposable income for books. That is the bottom line. That is what publishers listen to and what bookstores sell. So, we're here to stay,\" she said.",
            "Author and one of the organisers, Kelly L Clarke, from Vredehoek, said the conference brought local romance readers and authors together to discuss and celebrate the beloved genre and showcase Capetonian talent.",
            "\"We had a wonderful, engaged crowd who was excited to engage with our authors and showed so much support,\" she said."
