            "On a family trip in 2022, Emma Roma Jayne stayed in the car as everyone else went to the beach. The thought of being in shorts in public, and having the body she was so insecure about on display, made her feel viscerally uncomfortable.",
            "Roma Jayne, a TikTok creator and influencer partnership manager in Australia, had always struggled with her weight. She said she tried to eat healthily, trying different diets and exercising \"all the time,\" but she wasn't losing weight.",
            "After the beach trip, her mom told her enough was enough.",
            "\"She was like: 'This isn't right. You're 22. You should be enjoying your life and be able to go to the beach whenever you want and feel comfortable.' She suggested that I should get weight loss surgery like she had,\" Roma Jayne told Business Insider.",
            "So, in 2023, Roma Jayne had bariatric surgery, and her relationship with food and her body has been totally different since.",
            "\"At first, I was very much like: 'That's cheating. You need to put in the hard work to lose weight.' But I looked at weight loss surgery as a way that I could stop the food noise and then change my lifestyle, because I didn't want to spend the next 10 years still struggling with the same issues,\" she said.",
            "She lost about 110 pounds in the year after the surgery. Now 24, she's lost a further 22 pounds in the year since — and kept the weight off — having made huge lifestyle changes; she now works out six times a week and eats a high-protein, low-carb, balanced diet.",
            "A study published last year found that bariatric surgery was becoming less common but that more people were being prescribed drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro to lose weight.",
            "Roma Jayne said weight loss surgery \"is the best decision I have ever made in my entire life.\"",
            "\"It has transformed my life completely,\" she said.",

            "Her feet are slimmer now, and she went from a US size 9 shoe to a 7.5.",
            "A 2014 study published in the Turkish Journal of Surgery found that 80% of the 212 participants, who all underwent bariatric surgery, bought shoes at least one size smaller a year after the surgery. The researchers suggested this could be because of fat loss on the foot, as well as the arches getting higher once there is less weight pushing them down."

However, the authors said that these results weren't conclusive and that more research needed to be done."
