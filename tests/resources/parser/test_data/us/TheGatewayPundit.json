            "There is a new plot twist in the Idaho quadruple murders case.",
            "Bethany Funke, one of the two surviving roommates who was on the first/basement floor during the murders, has agreed to an interview with suspected killer Brian Kohberger’s defense attorney.",
            "Bryan Kohberger, 28, is accused of fatally stabbing 20-year-old Ethan Chapin of Conway, Washington; 21-year-old Madison Mogen of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; 20-year-old Xana Kernodle of Avondale, Arizona; and 21-year-old Kaylee Goncalves of Rathdrum, Idaho on November 13.",
            "According to the court documents, Kohberger’s DNA was found on a tan leather knife sheath left behind on Maddie Mogen’s bed on the 3rd floor at the King Road Residence.",
            "“The sheath was later processed and had ‘Ka-Bar’ ‘USMC’ and the United States Marine Corps eagle globe and anchor insignia stamped on the outside of it,” Idaho police officer Brett Payne wrote in the 19-page affidavit. “The Idaho state lab later located a single source of male DNA (suspect Profile) left on the button snap of the knife sheath.”",
            "Pennsylvania unsealed search warrants that revealed a number of items seized by law enforcement from Bryan Kohberger’s parents’ home during a December 30 raid.",
            "Authorities seized black gloves, a Glock, a knife (possibly the murder weapon?), black face masks, ‘green leafy substance’ in a plastic bag and other items.",
            "Police also seized parts of Bryan Kohberger’s white Hyundai Elantra.",
            "Bethany Funke agreed to be interviewed by the defense team.",
            "Kohberger’s defense team issued Funke a subpoena to testify, claiming she has exculpatory information that might help exonerate the suspected killer.",
            "Funke’s lawyers filed a motion to quash the subpoena, however, the surviving roommate agreed to be interviewed in Reno, Nevada where she’s from.",
            "More from NBC’s TODAY:",
            "The preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 26 at 9 am."
