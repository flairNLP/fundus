          "paragraphs": [
            "One of the perennial complaints emanating from the Strava community is that users sometimes cheat to attain lofty leaderboard positions on the app. Leaderboards are one of Strava’s core features, designed to stir competition by allowing users to challenge each other over predefined routes called “segments.” Cheating might involve something like using a motorbike or e-bike rather than a pedal bike to set a record, for instance.",
            "Strava already has some mechanisms in place to let users manually flag dubious leaderboard activity, and last year, the company updated its algorithms to “make leaderboards more credible.” That included withholding activities that may have been incorrectly labeled (e.g., users tagging a run as a bike ride), or where faulty GPS data might be at play.",
            "Now Strava says it will start using more sophisticated machine learning to detect “questionable” activities when they’re uploaded to the platform and automatically remove said activities. The company says it is doing so by training its algorithms on millions of historical activities to better understand what “normal” activity looks like.",
            "Apparently, this is one of Strava’s most-requested features, with a quick glance at its fervent online community revealing various ideas on how to deal with the “digital doping” problem.",
            "When pushed to provide more details on how this works, and how exactly it differs from its existing automated leaderboard integrity tooling, chief product officer Matt Salazar merely said that it’s a “step-change” in how Strava is using AI, machine learning, and other technologies to “close gaps.”",
            "“Last year, the team implemented new logic rules to existing auto-flagging tools, and now, we are leveraging newer technologies to deliver one of our most requested features from athletes,” Salazar said in a statement issued to TechCrunch.",
            "On a similar note, Strava on Thursday announced the private beta of a feature it’s calling “athlete intelligence,” which amounts to generative AI that analyzes user data to create summaries and guidance on their performance and fitness goals. This will be available to premium subscribers only.",
            "Strava wouldn’t confirm whether the underlying engine is one of OpenAI’s GPT-X models or something else, but Salazar did say the company is currently experimenting with different technologies ahead of a broader rollout.",
            "“We have several models and tools that we have looked at and currently applied a model that works for the beta,” Salazar said. “We’re continuing to evaluate what will provide the best result for our community.”",
            "Strava is also introducing dark mode, which, according to data on the Strava Community Hub, is the app’s second most desired feature by number of votes.",
            "This has been a long time coming, certainly compared to other popular apps — just last week, WhatsApp went so far as to launch an even “darker” dark mode.",
            "Still, better late than never. Strava says it will introduce dark mode “later this summer,” with the ability to keep the app permanently in dark mode or configure it so that it matches the device settings. This will be available to both premium and free users when it launches."

          ],
          "paragraphs": [
            "Similar to other online subscription services such as Spotify, Strava is now throwing its weight behind what it calls a “family plan” to entice bulk sign-ups through subscription discounts and get more people using the platform. Up to four people, including the primary subscriber, can be included in one family plan.",
            "But “family plan” is actually something of a misnomer here, as it doesn’t have to include actual family members or even anyone living at the same address. It can be anyone who lives in the same country.",
            "“It will create more opportunities for Strava athletes to continue finding and experiencing motivation, and make it more cost-effective too,” Salazar said. “The great part of this new annual subscription is that you choose who is part of your family plan — it can be your friends, running crew or teammates.”",
            "Playing liberally with the definition of “family” in this context does make sense, given that families won’t consume Strava in the same way as they might Netflix or Spotify. But the name of the plan might confuse some users in terms of who qualifies for coverage. Perhaps “group subscription plan” or something to that effect might make more sense.",
            "At any rate, Strava is still a little cagey on the details, including how much this bulk discount will amount to (it does say the percentage savings will vary by country), how one goes about sharing their subscription, and what happens in the event of a “family” fallout — can one member of a group easily keep their own account and data, for example?",
            "The new plan will kick off in “select countries” this summer, starting with Australia and Canada, with a broader international rollout following later in the year.",
            "These announcements come at a turbulent time for Strava. Co-founder Michael Horvath recently stepped down from the CEO position for the second time and was replaced in January by former YouTube executive Michael Martin. The company also last month procured a new chief technology officer (CTO) alongside Salazar, who left Epic Games to join Strava as chief product officer.",
            "The news also follows a year after Strava introduced a new premium pricing structure that drew considerable criticism over its lack of transparency.",
            "However, it’s clear that Strava is trying to bolster its value proposition for users, borrowing some tried-and-true tricks from the wider social networking sphere. The importance of Strava’s social positioning can’t be understated in terms of differentiating it from other data-centric fitness tracking services such as Apple Fitness or Garmin. This is why Strava rolled out in-app messaging last year, intended to foster communities that exist entirely within Strava without having to rely on third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp to organize events and outings.",
            "These new updates build on that, mixing free features that everyone gets with premium features for power users."

          ],
          "paragraphs": [
            "One way Strava can entice new users is by broadening its appeal to different demographics. It’s doing just that with an upcoming new feature that builds on its existing global heatmaps feature, which highlights the most well-trodden running, riding, and walking routes.",
            "Taking things a step further, “night heatmaps,” when it launches later this year, will focus specifically on activities that happen between sundown and sunrise, which might be useful for those concerned about going out for a walk or a jog in less-trafficked areas. This, Strava hopes, will help encourage more women to start using the platform, though in reality it will appeal to anyone wishing to avoid quieter places in the wee hours.",
            "“Studies show that women of all ages participate in sports at a far lower rate than men, and overall, despite wanting to be active, find less time to dedicate to an active lifestyle,” Strava wrote in a blog post accompanying the announcements. “As the company continues on its mission to motivate people to live their best active lives, building for women on the platform will ultimately serve everyone in the Strava community.”",
            "On top of that, not everyone wants to share all their activity data with everyone all the time. Thus, Strava said it will launch a new “quick edit” feature that lets users more easily conceal certain metrics from their workout stats, the type of activity they did, their location, and more.",
            "While “quick edit” will be free, Strava says that night heatmaps will be a premium feature, meaning that anyone wanting to see what the safest routes are after dark will have to pony up $12/month or $80/year to access this.",
            "Strava wouldn’t confirm how many of its 125 million members are active users, or what the gender split is. But the company previously reported that women are “23% less likely than men to record any type of activity pre-sunrise, and 8% less likely to do so post-sunset.”",
            "But Salazar said that certain demographics are showing signs of growth on the platform.",
            "“Whilst we don’t provide exact details on the Strava community as a whole, what we can share is that globally and in the U.S., our user-demographic of Gen Z women has experienced great growth, taking it to twice that of what it was at this time last year,” he said."

            "Robotic process automation (RPA) came into vogue over a decade ago as enterprises turned to the tech to bolster their digital transformation efforts while reducing costs. Like an agent, RPA drives workflow automation. But it’s a much more rigid form, based on “if-then” preset rules for processes that can be broken down into strictly defined, discretized steps.",
            "“RPA can mimic human actions, such as clicking, typing or copying and pasting, to perform tasks faster and more accurately than humans,” Saikat Ray, VP analyst at Gartner, explained to TechCrunch in an interview. “However, RPA bots have limitations when it comes to handling complex, creative or dynamic tasks that require natural language processing or reasoning skills.”",
            "This rigidity makes RPA expensive to build — and considerably limits its applicability.",

Entire businesses have been made out of helping enterprises manage their RPA installations and prevent them from breaking.",
            "RPA vendors aren’t naive. They’re well aware of the challenges — and believe that generative AI could solve many of them without hastening their platforms’ demise. In RPA vendors’ minds, RPA and generative AI-powered agents can peacefully co-exist — and perhaps one day even grow to complement each other."

            "“These features provide customers generative AI models that are trained for their specific tasks,” Enslin told TechCrunch. “Our generative AI powers workloads such as text completion for emails, categorization, image detection, language translation, the ability to filter out personally identifiable information [and] quickly answering any people-topic-related questions based off of knowledge from internal data.”",
            "One of UiPath’s more recent explorations in the generative AI domain is Clipboard AI, which combines UiPath’s platform with third-party models from OpenAI, Google and others to — as Enslin puts it — “bring the power of automation to anyone that has to copy/paste.” Clipboard AI lets users highlight data from a form, and — leveraging generative AI to figure out the right places for the copied data to go — point it to another form, app, spreadsheet or database.",
            "“UiPath sees the need to bring action and AI together; this is where value is created,” Enslin said. “We believe the best performance will come from those that combine generative AI and human judgment — what we call human-in-the-loop — across end-to-end processes.”",
            "Automation Anywhere, UiPath’s main rival, is also attempting to fold generative AI into its RPA technologies.",

But, risks aside, he believes generative AI stands to add value to RPA by transforming the way these platforms work and “creating new possibilities for automation.”",
            "“Generative AI is a powerful technology that can enhance the capabilities of RPA platforms enabling them to understand and generate natural language, automate content creation, improve decision-making and even generate code,” Ray said. “By integrating generative AI models, RPA platforms can offer more value to their customers, increase their productivity and efficiency and expand their use cases and applications.”",
            "Craig Le Clair, principal analyst at Forrester, sees RPA platforms as being ripe for expansion to support autonomous agents and generative AI as their use cases grow. In fact, he anticipates RPA platforms morphing into all-around toolsets for automation — toolsets that help deploy RPA in addition to related generative AI technologies.",
            "“RPA platforms have the architecture to manage thousands of task automations and this bodes well for central management of AI agents,” he said. “Thousands of companies are well established with RPA platforms and will be open to using them for generative AI-infused agents. RPA has grown in part thanks to its ability to integrate easily with existing work patterns, through UI integration, and this will remain valuable for more intelligent agents going forward.”",
            "UiPath is already beginning to take steps in this direction with a new capability, Context Grounding, that entered preview earlier in the month. As Enslin explained it to me, Context Grounding is designed to improve the accuracy of generative AI models — both first- and third-party — by converting business data those models might draw on into an “optimized” format that’s easier to index and search.",
            "“Context Grounding extracts information from company-specific datasets, like a knowledge base or internal policies and procedures, to create more accurate and insightful responses,” Enslin said.",
            "If there’s anything holding RPA vendors back, it’s the ever-present temptation to lock customers in, Le Clair said. He stressed the need for platforms to “remain agnostic” and offer tools that can be configured to work with a range of current — and future — enterprise systems and workflows.",
            "To that, Enslin pledged that UiPath will remain “open, flexible and responsible.”",
            "“The future of AI will require a combination of specialized AI with generative AI,” he continued. “We want customers to be able to confidently use all kinds of AI.”",
            "White didn’t commit to neutrality exactly. But he emphasized that Automation Anywhere’s roadmap is being heavily shaped by customer feedback.",
            "“What we hear from every customer, across every industry, is that their ability to incorporate automation in many more use cases has increased exponentially with generative AI,” he said. “With generative AI infused into intelligent automation technologies like RPA, we see the potential for organizations to reduce operating costs and increase productivity. Companies who fail to adopt these technologies will struggle to compete against others who embrace generative AI and automation.”"
