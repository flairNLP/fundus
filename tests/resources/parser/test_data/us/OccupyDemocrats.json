            "North Carolina is one of a few states where an affair partner can be sued by the jilted spouse, and in this case, the target is a prominent GOP politician, accused of coercing a state employee into a sexual relationship, as well as group sex and more.",
            "North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore is accused of interfering with the relationship between former Apex Town Council member Scott Lassiter, and his wife, Jamie Liles Lassiter, a state employee.",
            "The lawsuit even alleges that Moore used his political power to prevent Ms. Lassiter from breaking off the relationship to reconcile with her husband, and from dangling political favors before Mr. Lassiter when admitting to the affair.",
            "In fact, he says that Ms. Lassiter confessed to the affair and said she was afraid she’d lose her job (as executive director of the North Carolina Conference of Clerks of Superior Court) if she rejected Moore — and that, among other things, he induced her into group sex with others who were seeking his political favor.",
            "He’s also alleging that someone, who he believes to be connected to Moore, entered his property — where he now lives alone since he and his wife separated in January — and installed a motion-sensing camera in a tree aimed at his porch.",
            "He says that he has footage of this individual on his own security cameras, including footage of the individual attempting to destroy Lassiter’s own camera.",
            "According to a copy of the filing obtained by the Daily Haymaker:",
            "“At approximately 3:18 a.m. on June 1, 2023, Defendant John Doe unlawfully and without authorization entered upon the property to surreptitiously install a motion- activated camera to capture photos and video recordings of Plaintiff without Plaintiff’s consent. Defendant John Doe installed the camera on a tree in Plaintiff’s yard at an angle facing Plaintiff’s house so that it could, upon information and belief, capture photos and video recordings of events inside and outside Plaintiff’s home.”",
            "Lassiter reportedly believes that the intent was to obtain photos and video with which to blackmail him into keeping Moore’s secret.",
            "Speaker Moore and Ms. Lassiter are denying everything, publicly (though Lassiter claims both admitted it in person and says he has photographic evidence aside from their admissions) — and it’s not even the first sexual scandal that the prominent Republican has had to issue a denial for this year.",
            "Earlier in the year, he denied allegations he was having an affair with fellow state Representative Tricia Cotham.",
            "That accusation would have been far less scandalous, since both were single at the time — except for the little fact that it was also linked in rumor to her sudden about-face, in which she changed parties, completely flipped her position on abortion access, and gave the proverbial middle finger to every North Carolinian who voted for her on promises of the protection of reproductive rights.",
            "Moore denied being in a relationship with Cotham back in April, according to The Assembly.",
            "However, the allegation that Moore induced Ms. Lassiter to engage in group sex with those who needed political favors from him is resurrecting this claim, as well as other speculation about exactly who else might be, consensually or otherwise, involved in this latest alleged scandal."
