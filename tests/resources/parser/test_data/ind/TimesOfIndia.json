        "Pakistan's military has initiated the Azm-e-Istehkam anti-terror operation to address 'digital terrorism' spread through social media. This move, which aims to counter misinformation and unrest, has raised concerns about internet surveillance and speed reductions. Rights activists warn that the initiative might be used to target government critics, particularly amid rising political tensions."

            "NEW DELHI: Pakistan's \"whole-of-system approach\" to countering militancy is evolving and may be taking a turn to the sinister as its army's new anti-terror operation 'Azm-e-Istehkam' (Resolve for Stability) is increasingly focusing on what it calls \"digital terrorism\".",
            "Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has over the past few months repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.",
            "He described the activities of \"inimical\" forces as a form of \"digital terrorism\" aimed at creating discord between the military and the public by spreading \"lies and fake news\".",
            "Launched in June, Azm-e-Istehkam is tackling not only traditional militancy, particularly in light of increasing attacks attributed to groups like the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but the evolving nature of threats in the digital landscape.",
            "The shift has sparked widespread concern with some analysts suggesting that the military is carrying out \"prejudiced online surveillance\" and curbing internet speeds across the country to battle the new \"digital threat\".",
            "The characterisation of digital terrorism in Munir's speeches have been notably vague, with rights activists noting that the term lacks a clear legal definition and could be weaponised against individuals who express criticism of the military or government policies online."

            "In recent months, Munir has repeatedly voiced \"concerns\" regarding the impact of social media on national security and public discourse.",
            "In May -- just months before launching Azm-e-Istehkam -- Munir highlighted the issue of \"negative propaganda\" on social media, asserting that it poses threats to the integrity and security of Pakistan. He emphasised the military's readiness to counter any conspiracies and condemned the spread of disinformation, urging adherence to constitutional limits on freedom of expression, particularly as outlined in Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which restricts incitement to violence and undermining national security.",
            "In August, Munir reiterated these concerns, stating that social media is being exploited to propagate \"anarchy\" and warned against campaigns targeting the military. His remarks came in the context of rising tensions and comparisons being drawn to political instability in neighboring countries.",
            "On August 14, he again criticised the misuse of social media for spreading chaos and false information, attributing \"digital terrorism\" to foreign elements. He stressed the state's responsibility to protect citizens from the adverse effects of social media-driven hysteria and urged the public to remain vigilant against misinformation.",
            "He also warned that social media was being exploited to propagate \"anarchy\". His remarks that \"anarchy is spread through social media\" followed a condemnation by the army of social media campaigns to target the Pakistan Armed Forces.",
            "\"Just as terrorists use weapons to get their demands met, digital terrorists use negative propaganda and fake news on social media platforms, mobiles and computers to create despondency to get their demands met,\" Pakistani military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said.",
            "Chaudhry said the military had become the sole target of digital terrorists, and blamed a \"certain\" political party without naming ousted PM Imran Khanâ€™s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, which has a formidable social media presence."

            "Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the military for orchestrating his removal from power in April 2022, and specifically named Munir as being responsible for his subsequent arrest in May 2023, claiming the Army chief harboured a \"personal grudge\" against him.",
            "Khan also alleged that Munir was behind the crackdown on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating: \"It is personal. It's got nothing to do with national interest\". He also accused Munir of \"dismantling the future of this country [Pakistan] to protect himself\".",
            "Khan's arrest led to riots in May where protesters for the first time in the nation's history vented their anger on the military attacking several army installations.",
            "Digital activism in Pakistan spiked following Imran's ouster, whose party has relied heavily on social media to coordinate its activities. After TV channels were banned from covering PTI events, Khan gave several speeches online challenging the military's role in politics.",
            "These online events were often marred by internet blackouts or slowdown. Though authorities have said the drop in internet speed was due to technical issues, activists have claimed that the army is strategically using a national firewall and manipulating the country's internet infrastructure to curb any dissenting voices on the web."

            "Pakistan has experienced a notable slowdown in internet speeds over the past few months, with reports indicating that up to 40% slower speeds have affected nearly half of the country's 241 million internet users.",
            "Users have reported difficulties in sending and receiving messages on platforms like WhatsApp and accessing social media sites, which are crucial for communication and information dissemination, especially among the youth and political activists.",
            "Information Technology minister Shiza Fatima Khawaja has confirmed that it was upgrading its \"web management system\" to cope with cybersecurity threats but did not link the development to slower internet speeds.",
            "TOI has reported that the Pakistan government tested its firewall on two occasions, once in July and a second time in mid-August. Pakistan has allocated more than $70 million for a Digital Infrastructure Development Initiative in the latest budget.",
            "The timing of these frequent slowdowns also coincides with the launch of operation Azm-e-Istehkam, raising questions about whether the internet disruptions are also linked to efforts to control information amid rising political tensions and protests against the military's actions.",
            "Technology experts have suggested that the newly implemented internet firewall could provide the government with enhanced capabilities to censor online content, drawing comparisons to China's stringent internet regulations.",
            "Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content."
