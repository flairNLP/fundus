# We Want You!

First and foremost, thank you for thinking about making Fundus better.
We aim to tackle news scraping by using domain-specific parsers to achieve precise extraction.
To handle this substantial workload, we rely on contributions from people like you.

# What is Fundus

Fundus strives to be a lightweight, easy to use yet precise news-scraping library.
At its core, Fundus is a parser library that focuses on handcrafted parsers instead of fully automated extraction.
Consequently, to enable Fundus to parse news from specific domains, someone needs to create a parser tailored to that domain.
Given the multitude of news domains, there are countless opportunities for contributions.

# Setup Fundus

Before contributing to Fundus, ensure that you have installed Fundus in `editable` mode and are using the development requirements.
If you haven't done this yet or are uncertain, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Optional but recommended: Create a virtual environment (.venv) or conda environment.
3. Navigate to the root of the repository.
4. Run `pip install -e .[dev]`
